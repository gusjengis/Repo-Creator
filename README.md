# Repo-Creator
Super useful script, just paste it in a folder, run it, and it will turn the contents of that folder into a new git repo with that folder's name and push it to your github page.

Just remember to uncomment the line in the .gitignore and paste that in the folder along with the batch file. Otherwise the batch file will be included in your repo.

Know that this does require that you have gh installed and have run the ```gh auth login``` command already.
